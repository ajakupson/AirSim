                    The Western Australian Institute for Medical Research will today take ownership of a private cloud solution built almost entirely of open source technologies to prepare for an influx of researchers over the coming weeks. The $200 million medical research project - recently renamed the Harry Perkins Institute for Medical Research - will house over 1200 external researchers in two greenfield Perth campus buildings. These researchers, from 40+ independent research groups, aim to solve complex problems such as the genetic and environmental causes of cancer and diabetes. The projectâ€™s IT posture has been designed and delivered by independent IT consultant Titan ICT, which over recent months has built out data centres in each of the two locations, connected via high-speed fibre (MPLS) and wireless (802.1x) networks. Around 140 researchers and support staff moved in this week, with the remainder to follow in staggered groups. Titan ICT went to tender for a private cloud solution to host a set of shared services the Institute will deliver to research tenants, based on some unique requirements.

                    Taiwanese based solid state storage and power supply maker OCZ, which is currently in the clutches of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claims it has reached an asset purchase agreement with Japanese electronics giant Toshiba. Under the deal, Toshiba will "substantially acquire" all of OCZ's assets for US$35 million. This includes OCZ's client and enterprise software businesses, which gives Toshiba access to intellectual property covering proprietary flash memory controllers, firmware and software. OCZ chief executive Ralph Schmitt said the company's business has failed over the past year due to NAND flash supply constraints and credit issues. Toshiba will provide debtor in possession finance to ensure that OCZ can continue its business during the sale period.

                    Computer scientists have developed malware capable of establishing communications between devices that don't have active network connections, threatening the reliability of the "air gap" frequently used to protect information. Using the built-in microphones and speakers found on PCs, the lab-created prototype malware that uses inaudible audio signals to transmit small amounts of data over covert channels at distances of nearly 65 feet. The distance can be increased by creating a network of devices that repeat the signals. The proof-of-concept software, detailed in the Journal of Communications, suggests that a lack of an Internet connection isn't enough to insulate sensitive internal computer systems from the outside world. The research comes after the recent disclosure of mysterious malware that used high-frequency signals to hurdle between non-connected devices.
